Hi, I’m Gavin Sidhu.                                           
I'm currently a student at UNC Charlotte.         
I’m interested in Data Science positions and applying knowledge of data analysis and the cloud to help in making business decisions.  
I’m currently learning more about cloud technologies and working towards my solutions architect associate with AWS (Amazon Web Services).  
I’m looking to work as an intern in the data science field over the summer.  
I'm currently a Bachelors student but will graduate in May 2022, and will finish my Masters in only one year and will graduate with that in May of 2023.  
You can reach me at gsidhu2@uncc.edu
